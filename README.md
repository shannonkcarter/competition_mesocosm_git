mesocosm experiment manipulating relative mean and synchrony of hatching phenology of 2 species of competing tadpoles

QUESTION: 1) What are the independent and interactive effects of phenological mean and phenological synchrony on population demography and competitive outcomes? 2) Does phenological synchrony change across ontogenetic stages?

STUDY SYSTEM: 360L aquatic mesocosm experiment using tadpoles of competing species Hyla versicolor and Rana sphenocephala.

METHODS:
1) collect egg clutches and rear in lab, keeping in cold vs. warm rooms to encourage hatching according to phenological manipulations
2) set up mesocosms: fill with hose water; cover with shade cloth; add nutrients, plankton innoculate, leaf litter
3) add tadpole hatchlings according to phenology manipulations
4) monitor mesocosms daily and collect any tadpoles that have metamorphosed into frogs
5) weigh and release each metamorph the day after it is removed from the mesocosm
6) disassemble mesocosms when metamorph accumulation slows

RESULTS: 1) lots, depends on which response variable you're considering. Mean is always important, synchrony is often important, mean and synchrony often interact 2) yes
